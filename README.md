## ESeva - "Donate, Earn, and Nourish with Every Meal"
#### Problem: 
Excess food from large events or organizations often goes to waste, while many charitable organizations and communities could benefit from this surplus.

#### Solution: 

- Individuals or organizations (e.g., hotels, marriage halls) can upload details about excess food.

- In return, they earn points or coins that can be redeemed for discounts on essential government services (electricity bills, gas cylinders, ration items, etc.).

- Charitable organizations like trusts, child care centers, and orphanages receive notifications and can claim the food for distribution.
